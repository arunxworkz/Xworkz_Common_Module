Great ‚Äî if your website is already hosted on your EC2 instance, and you modify files locally, you need to re-upload those updated files to the server so they reflect on your live website.

üîÅ How to Reflect File Changes on Your Hosted Website
‚úÖ Option 1: Using WinSCP (Recommended for Static Files)
Open WinSCP

Connect to your EC2 instance

In the local pane, find your modified file(s) (e.g., index.html, style.css, etc.)

In the remote pane, go to:

css
Copy
Edit
/var/www/html/
Drag and drop the updated files from local ‚Üí remote

Overwrite when prompted

‚úÖ Option 2: Using SCP from Terminal (Linux/macOS/WSL)
bash
Copy
Edit
scp -i your-key.pem /path/to/index.html ec2-user@<your-ec2-ip>:/var/www/html/
‚úÖ Option 3: Modify Directly via SSH (if needed)
You can also edit files directly on the server:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /var/www/html/index.html
Make changes, save, and exit.

üîÑ No Need to Restart Apache
For static files (HTML, CSS, JS), changes apply immediately after upload. Just:

Clear browser cache, if needed

Reload the page: Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
